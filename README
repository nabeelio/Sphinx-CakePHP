Derived version from the Sphinx Behavior by @nshahzad

Updated version for the Sphinx Behavior by Vilen Tambovtsev

I've updated this for Cake2.0, and also so it runs one query to Sphinx,
instead of two (one for results, one for count)

Also makes the search results that are returned from Sphinx available to
the model (I use this to build filters for search)

The original usage page is here:
